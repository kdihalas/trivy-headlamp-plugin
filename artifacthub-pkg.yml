  - After install you may need to restart Headlamp.

  ## In-cluster Headlamp
  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/).
  - Configure helm values for Headlamp to add an initContainer for downloading the tarball. See [example helm values](https://github.com/Kubebeam/kubescape-headlamp-plugin/blob/main/examples/headlamp-helm-values.yaml). The tarball for the plugin is saved in the asset list for the [release](https://github.com/kubebeam/trivy-headlamp-plugin/releases).

  # Trivy Headlamp Plugin

  The Trivy Headlamp plugin provides an open source plugin for Headlamp. It builds upon the work of [Trivy Operator](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator) and [Headlamp](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp).

  Headlamp is a dashboard for Kubernetes, and is extensible with plugins. Trivy Operator is a security platform protecting against configuration issues and image vulnerabilities.

  The Trivy Headlamp plugin provides views in Headlamp for configuration and vulnerabilities scanning, based on information delivered by the Trivy operator.

  ## Prerequisites

  - [Trivy operator](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator/) should be installed in the k8s cluster and enabled for configuration and image scanning.
  - [Headlamp](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp) should be installed in the k8s cluster or workstation. For a quick test the desktop version is recommended.

  The plugin has been tested with Headlamp v0.25.0 (browser and desktop) and Trivy operator helm chart v0.24.1.

  ## Use cases

  The plugin provides view pages for Trivy custom resources, such as clustercompliance, configaudit, exposedsecret, infraassessment, rbacassessment, sbomreport and vulnerabilityreports.

  ## Installation

  #### Desktop Headlamp

  - Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/).

  #### In-cluster Headlamp

- Install Headlamp (https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/)
